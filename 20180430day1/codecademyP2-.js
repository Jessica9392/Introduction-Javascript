///9 Review Types and Operators
/*
Four essential data types in JavaScript include strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
Data is printed, or logged, to the console with console.log().
Four built-in mathematical operators include +, -, *, and /.
JavaScript associates certain properties with different data types.
JavaScript has built-in methods for different data types.
Libraries are collections of methods that can be called without an instance.
You can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.
